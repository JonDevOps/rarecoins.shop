Terms and Conditions
We stand behind our rare coins 100%. If you decide for any reason you would like to return your non-bullion item anytime within 30 days of purchase, there is no restocking charge and depending on how the market price has changed we will try to give you a 100% refund. Due to market volatility for gold coins and bullion and silver bullion, all sales are final on such items.

If a product is not in stock, you can lock in that day’s price for gold or silver for a minimum down payment of 20%. For pre-orders, you can make a down payment or you can pay in full. However, if pre-orders are not paid in full within the time period provided, your order may be cancelled and refunds will be based on the market value of the metal.

FAQ’s
Q: Do you purchase non-US currency?
A: Exotic or non-US currency is always interesting to us because it may contain gold or silver or other metals which collectors find valuable.

Q: Do you purchase collectible currency?
A: We are always searching for US paper dollars dated 1963 and older. And based on the collectibility, we are also looking for international currency of any date.

Q: How are payments issued?
A: Payments can be made by cash, check, wire transfer or cashier’s check depending on your preference.

Q: How do you determine the price for gold or silver?
A: The price is determined by the condition. If the item is flawless and ready for bullion investment, then it commands a higher value. Jewelry is valued a little lower because there is an added cost for converting it into a pure metal. Whether it is finished or in jewelry form, the calculation is based on real-time market prices.

Q: Is pre-sorting a must?
A: If you choose to sort your own collection, feel free to ask questions of our experts. However, sorting beforehand is not necessary because we have trained staff that will assess your collection, make classifications for it and decide the best possible grade. For a beginner, this process can be a difficult one. That’s why we have a certified numismatist at each location to make your visit as stress free as possible.

Q: Is an appointment required?
A: No. We are open for business Monday through Saturday, and all five locations have friendly professionals on staff to assist you.
